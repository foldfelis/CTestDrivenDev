# CTestDrivenDev
This repository is a demonstration work flow to Test-Driven Development in C

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/foldfelis/CTestDrivenDev.svg?token=sCvSBz8RcnVXPVQx1yrZ&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/foldfelis/CTestDrivenDev)
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/foldfelis/CTestDrivenDev/branch/master/graph/badge.svg?token=VPVSJ951DN)](https://codecov.io/gh/foldfelis/CTestDrivenDev)

Here, the demonstration shows a Test-Driven Development process by using only assert library.
And tested by running an old-fashioned yet classic makefile.
Finally, the `gcov` is called to generate the code coverage report.
